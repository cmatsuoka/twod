twoD is a very simple 2D gaming engine created for didactic purposes, using
Allegro 5.

I'm developing this om my free time, so things are going slowly :(

*Completed:*
- basic structure
- keyboard keys events
- framerate control
- animated sprites
- play sounds
- text drawing
- draw objects according to layers
- primitives support
- texturized primitives

*To be done:*
- movement support (with speed, direction, physics)
- collision detection (simple version)
- menu generators
- tiles support (for map/background building)
- parallax scrolling

*Future optimizations:*
- multi-thread operations (for better performance)
- error handling
- enhanced collision detection
- enhanced physics
- make sure no memory is leaking

Yeah, there's still a long way to go :D
