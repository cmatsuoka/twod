twoD
====

twoD is a very simple 2D gaming engine created for didactic purposes using
Allegro 5 and licensed under the LGPL 3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt>.

I'm developing this on my free time, so things are going slowly :(

*Completed:*
- basic structure
- keyboard keys events
- framerate control
- animated sprites
- play sounds
- text drawing (with buffering)
- draw objects according to layers
- primitives support
- texturized primitives
- movement support (speed, direction)
- collision detection (simple version)

*To be done:*
- Physics (simple version)
- tiles support (for map/background building)
- parallax scrolling
- menu generators

*Future optimizations:*
- enhanced movement (using angles instead of cardinal points)
- multi-thread operations (for better performance)
- error handling
- enhanced physics
- make sure no memory is leaking
- enhanced collision detection

Yeah, there's still a long way to go :D
